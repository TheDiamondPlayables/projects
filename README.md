# Projects:
This contains all releases I've ever made and am maintaining. The ones I have access to anyway.
<br>They're all in a pretty neat format, so you can effectively download anything with ease if you know your way around the system.

# Versioning:
Ever since 1.19.3, if you use a version that wasn't designed for the Minecraft release you're on, [you're going to have issues](https://web.archive.org/web/20221025032759/https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/9971900758413).
<br>(because Mojang's changed how their updates work)
<br>To combat this, I've devised a Version Numbering Scheme that aims to let you know which version was built for which Release.
## How it works:
It's quite simple: Look at the letter in the version number. That shows you the Minecraft Release it was built for.
- `-` means it's for the base version:
  - 20-x => for 1.20, 21-x => for 1.21, ...
- `a` = `.1`, `b` = `.2`, and so on:
  - 20`c`x => for 1.20`.3`, 20`b`x => for 1.20`.2`, ...
  - There's no way we'd reach past update `.26`, which is `z` for this numbering scheme.
- **Note that if the Release itself only contains bugfixes, roll back a letter!**
  - 20`d`x would've been designed for 1.20`.4`, but since that update only has some bugfixes, 20`c`x is built for 1.20.3 and 1.20.4 as well.

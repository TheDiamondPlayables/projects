# Releases:
This contains all releases I've ever made. The ones I have access to anyway.
<br>They're all in a pretty neat format, so you can effectively download anything with ease if you know your way around the system.

# License:
For personal use: Pretty much anything goes. Just donâ€™t do anything illegal or infringing on others.
<br>(If it has anything related to do with other people, **it's not personal use**)
<br>For commercial use: This is not allowed unless you've gotten direct permission from me to do so. Some exceptions:
- You can make a video using my releases, which can then be monetized.
- You can host a server using my releases, and make money from that.
  - **Regardless of the exception**: You must always provide a link of the releases being used in a visible area.
  - [Maybe help me out, too](https://www.patreon.com/thediamondplayables) if you're getting something using my projects, so I could keep them updated for the forseeable future.

Also: You can't publish builds based off of the Interactive Help File's data without my direct permission.
